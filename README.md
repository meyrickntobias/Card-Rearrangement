# Card-Rearrangement

This was an assignment for COSC241 at the University of Otago - Programming and Problem Solving.

The problem was to create a simulation of dealing a pack of cards, of size n, in rows of length r in different ways - from top to bottom or bottom to top, and left to right or right to left. So each row would contain n/j cards, represented as integers. The solution was to be given as Java, and the program can be run at the command line after compiling as:

java week11/CP n r
  where:
n = number of cards
r = length of row

This will show all of the possible specifications for that pile size and row length. There is also the option of supplying your own specification such as BL for bottom-left which would start from bottom-top then from left-right. The resulting pack of cards would be the output. 

Please try for yourself by running CP, already compiled in the week11 folder.
